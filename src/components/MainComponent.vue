            <p>I'm currently in my third year of studying at the University of York, working towards a BSc/BEng in computer science. I designed 
            this page to supplement my cv and give people a way to get to know me and the kind of work I do. Below, you'll find links to a few of my
            Github projects and When I'm not too busy studying for 
            my next AI exam, I enjoy working on personal projects, reading, attending hackathons and playing the guitar/drums! </p>
