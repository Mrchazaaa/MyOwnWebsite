* on firefox, previous work icons are not centered properly. I imagine this is because of the hacky 1px method used to center them on other browsers. update to use flexbox properly.

[] move scss code to external files
[] refactor code for cleanliness

[] add dark theme button
[] browser compatibility
[] add codeacademy badges?
[] add hackerwars badges?
[] add scholarship news article
[] instead of More/Less buttons, make sections titles the buttons
[] make mobile version take up full width

[x] migrate to Heroku? Redirect charliehowlett.com dns? (actually changed to netify cdn hosting)
[] live updates of codewars badges through scraping?

[] add last tracking of last project that I worked on (using github api to find last accessed repo)

[] make title page text chunkier and bigger for impace. Perhaps also use a nice looking font

[] update work done and CV !!!

Potential branches:
[] Redesign website for minamilism
[] Redesign color schemes
