Done:
[x] add codeacademy badges?
[x] add codewars badges?
[x] add scholarship news article (they didnt upload your name in the article :) so make a little award poster about being an awardee)
[x] migrate to Heroku? Redirect charliehowlett.com dns? (actually changed to netify cdn hosting)
[x] give list items chevron rotation animation on click
[x] figure out why on firefox, previous work icons are not centered properly. I imagine this is because of the hacky 1px method used to center them on other browsers. update to use flexbox properly.

In progress:
[] Redesign website for minamilism
[] refactor code for cleanliness

Todo:
[] Redesign color scheme
[] update work done and CV !!!
[] make title page text chunkier and bigger for impact. Perhaps also use a nice looking font
[] move to scss and refactor to external style files
[] add dark theme button
[] make mobile version take up full width
[] browser compatibility
[] instead of More/Less buttons, make sections titles the buttons
[] make cloud speed relative to browser width
[] parallax cloud speeds
[] cache first paint clouds for quick rendering
[] add link to personal curated spotify playlist for coding backing music
[] remove unnecessary javascript libraries for faster performance

[] display title page with css grid for positioning chevron and title easier


Maybe:
[] add last tracking of last project that I worked on (using github api to find last accessed repo)?
[] live updates of codewars badges through scraping?
[] add loading screen for site startup?
[] add buttons for options in cloud generation
